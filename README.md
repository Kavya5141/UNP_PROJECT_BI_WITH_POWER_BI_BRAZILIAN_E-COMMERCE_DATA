# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E-COMMERCE_DATA

In collaboration with UNP, I developed the Brazilian E-commerce Dashboard, offering valuable insights into customer distribution and performance metrics. The dashboard examines customer demographics, sales trends, product performance, order fulfillment, delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and payment preferences. It highlights strong sales, high customer engagement, and efficient delivery operations while identifying areas for improvement. Key growth opportunities include expanding payment options, optimizing product selection, and boosting sales through targeted marketing and enhanced customer engagement. This data-driven approach supports informed content recommendations and strategic decision-making in the e-commerce sector.
