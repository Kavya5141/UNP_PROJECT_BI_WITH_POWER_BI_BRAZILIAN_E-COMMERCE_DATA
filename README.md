# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E-COMMERCE_DATA

In collaboration with UNP, I developed the Brazilian E-commerce Dashboard, providing key insights into customer distribution and performance metrics. The dashboard analyzes customer demographics, sales trends, product performance, order fulfillment, delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and payment preferences. It highlights strong sales, high customer engagement, and effective delivery operations while identifying opportunities for improvement. Expanding payment options, optimizing product selection, and revitalizing sales through targeted marketing and enhanced customer engagement are key areas for growth. This data-driven approach enables informed content recommendations and strategic business decisions in the e-commerce sector.
